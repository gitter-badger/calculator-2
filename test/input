# Each line started from '#' character will be ignored
# Each line which are not started from '#' character will be considered as
# input for test
# 
# Each test starts from description line in the following format:
# <mark>: <count of input lines> <count of output lines>
#
# <mark> is just a label. Cannot contain ':' symbol
#
# First <count of input lines> lines will be provided as input for testing
# application and <count of output lines> will be compared with output of
# testing application. If they will be equal, then test will passed. And failed
# otherwise.
#
# Empty lines out of test context will be ignored
#
# To include test cases from external file, you can use the following directive:
# include "<file name>"

include "expressions.input"
include "where.input"
